Here are a few **next possible updates** for this project `Inventory_CLI_Manager` — each selected to be **practical**, **resume-worthy**, and aligned with my **Python learning journey**:

---

### 🔄 1. **Add Quantity Field to Each Product**

Track how many items are available in stock.

* `{ name: "mouse", price: 899, quantity: 10 }`
* Allow increasing/decreasing quantity on sale/purchase.

🧠 *Why it's good*: Introduces nested updates, and prepares for inventory stock logic.

---

### 🗂️ 2. **Search Products by Name or Price Range**

Let users search products by:

* Exact name (case-insensitive)
* Partial match (`"pen"` should match `"pen drive"`)
* Price range (e.g., all products between 500 and 1500)

🧠 *Why it's good*: Enhances usability, introduces filtering logic, and reinforces string/list handling.

---

### ✏️ 3. **Update Product Details**

Allow updating a product’s:

* Name
* Price
* Quantity

🧠 *Why it's good*: Strengthens control structures and user interaction logic.

---

### 📊 4. **Inventory Summary Report**

Show:

* Total products
* Total value of inventory (sum of `price × quantity`)
* Most expensive & cheapest product

🧠 *Why it's good*: Introduces basic analytics, calculations, and sorting — essential data handling practice.

---

### 📤 5. **Export Inventory to CSV**

Add an option to save inventory as a `.csv` file:

* Column headers: Name, Price, Quantity
* Useful for business reports or spreadsheet use

🧠 *Why it's good*: Teaches file formatting, CSV library, and real-world data export tasks.

---

### 🔒 6. **Add Admin Authentication (Basic)**

Require a username/password at startup to use the app.

🧠 *Why it's good*: Basic intro to user authentication and simple security practices.

---

✅ All of these are **beginner-friendly**, realistic, and offer valuable learning opportunities.
